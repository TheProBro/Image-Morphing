# Image-Morphing
Morph two images over the web!


The morphing works on a trained ML model of face detection, and uses open-cv library to run on the server.
The javascript server file runs the python file and sends over the result to the front-end for a beautiful image morphing result
To run the server, install dependencies from the package.json and viola! you are ready to run the app
